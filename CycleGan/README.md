# EITN35 - AI CycleGan

# This is a project for training a CycleGan

Training an algorithm which will be used to transform images between different domains.


## Setup
Organize input frames into two separate folders, one for each domain. Update `path`, `dataA1`, `dataB1` in `CycleGan-ProcessImages.py` accordingly.

## Usage
`CycleGanCode.py` is the main file which trains a model from scratch. Update `dataset` on row 282 with the .npz file generated by `CycleGan-ProcessImages.py`.
`CycleGan-ProcessImages.py` is processing the images from each domain folder and generates a combined .npz file which is later used in `CycleGanCode.py` to train the model.
`Cycle-ImageGenerator.py` and `Cycle-ImageGenerator-singles.py` uses the trained model to transform images.
`Model_layers_10_GanTest.py` and `Model_layers_2_GanTest.py` are testing images with a image recognition model. Update `test_dir` to fit the folder with images to be tested. The input for model.load_weights(), `model_dir` and second input needs to be updated to fit the wanted weights.

Run the command:

```bash
python CycleGan-ProcessImages.py 
python CycleGanCode.py
```
